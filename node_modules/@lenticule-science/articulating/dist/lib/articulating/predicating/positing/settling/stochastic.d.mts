 * settling/stochastic — settling over the stochastic semiring (Markov, martingale).
 *
 * The value-category hub runs settling over any `V`. Its `stochastic-settling`
 * child takes `V` to be the **stochastic semiring** `([0,1], ·, +)` — `·` as
 * probability along a path, `+` as the convex combine over alternative paths — and
 * the canonical instance is Markov-chain transition settling: a finite state space,
 * a transition kernel `P`, and the closure step `T_stoch(v)(s,o) = Σ_z v(s,z)·P(z,o)`
 * (one matrix multiply). The **stationary distribution** `π` (with `π·P = π`) is the
 * settling's fixed point. Ported from `lean/RelMath/Probability/Stochastic.lean`.
 *
 * No reals, no rationals: the probability semiring is taken **abstractly** (a carrier
 * with `0/1/+/·` and a partial order), and the canonical `Nat` (counting-weight)
 * instance reuses relating's exact-number arithmetic. The Perron–Frobenius/stationary
 * content is structural over the abstract value. The headline finance reading: a
 * **martingale = a stationary process = a stochastic-closure fixed point** — the
 * substrate of the no-arbitrage / risk-neutral measure (FTAP).
