/**
 * settling/monotonicity-certificate — coordination cost from cover cohomology.
 *
 * A federated statement names a source, a logical cell, and the stance that source
 * contributes for that cell. For each logical cell we build the cover nerve as the
 * bipartite graph `source -- stance`, compute H¹ with the existing predication
 * cohomology reader, and expose exactly the nonzero H¹ cells as coordination
 * obstructions. No protocol operation names participate in this certificate.
