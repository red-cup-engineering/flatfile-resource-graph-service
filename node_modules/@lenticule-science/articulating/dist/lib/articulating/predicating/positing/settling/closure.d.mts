/**
 * settling/closure — bounded ordinal closure as carrier data.
 *
 * This module is the Node-side workbench for processes that can be read as
 * repeated application of a monotone endomorphism on a caller-supplied lattice.
 * It does not try to be a general ordinal runtime. It gives ordinary Node code
 * an observable closure carrier: the orbit from bottom, the searched
 * stabilization stage, and a finite / Scott / transfinite regime read when the
 * bounded search finds a witness.
 *
 * Ordinals are built as zero / successor / labelled limit with a fundamental
 * sequence; a `Lattice<T>` carries bottom, leq, join, eq, and a stabilizing sup;
 * a `ClosureProcessCarrier<T>` is an endomorphism over that lattice with a
 * search horizon. `closeOrdinalProcess` iterates from bottom, recording the
 * finite orbit it actually evaluates, then probes finite and labelled limit
 * stages for stabilization. The result is a witness or obstruction, never an
 * implicit claim that all transfinite behavior has been decided.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import * as settling from "@lenticule-science/articulating/predicating/positing/settling";
 *
 * const eq = (left, right) => left === right;
 * const lattice = {
 *   bottom: 0,
 *   leq: (left, right) => left <= right,
 *   join: (left, right) => Math.max(left, right),
 *   eq,
 *   sup: settling.stabilizingSup({ eq }),
 * };
 *
 * const process = settling.closureProcess(lattice, (value) => Math.min(3, value + 1));
 * const closed = settling.closeOrdinalProcess(process);
 *
 * closed.search.kind; // "ordinal.closure.stabilizationSearch:witness"
 * closed.search.regime.kind; // "ordinal.closure.regime.finite"
 * ```
 *
 * @see closeOrdinalProcess
