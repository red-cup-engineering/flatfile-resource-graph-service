/**
 * settling/dynamics/substitution/mld - finite MLD-invariant comparisons.
 *
 * This module names the mutually-locally-derivable reading that the Node package
 * can currently execute: compare the finite cohomological invariant carried by
 * two substitution incidence matrices. The invariant is the same structure
 * returned by {@link colimStructure}: rank, determinant, Smith normal form,
 * stable determinant, and localized integer module.
 *
 * The result stays in the package's witness/obstruction idiom. Equal invariants
 * produce a `substitution.dynamics.mld:witness`; unequal invariants produce an
 * obstruction naming the first separating component. This is useful as the
 * implemented Anderson-Putnam-classifier layer. It is not an arbitrary tiling
 * equivalence solver, and it does not construct local derivation maps between
 * raw tilings.
 *
 * Grounding: `lean/RelMath/Aperiodic/StepN/*`, the RelMath aperiodic import
 * spine, and the content aperiodic-regime classification notes. The public
 * authority here is the finite invariant comparison implemented below.
 *
