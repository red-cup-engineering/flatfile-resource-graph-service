/**
 * settling/value-category — settling over a value category `V` (the universal `F_U` over `V`).
 *
 * The spine settles **charges**: the closure `cl = ◇∘□` iterates on the FOUR
 * bilattice to its fixed point. The corpus's `continuous-valued-settling` node
 * generalizes this — settling is parametric in a **value category** `V`, and the
 * *same* settling dynamics run over any complete/residuated lattice of values
 * (the Lawvere quantale, a continuous lattice, fuzzy `[0,1]`, the four-valued
 * bilattice FOUR, or the Boolean `{0,1}`). Settling is the universal closure `F_U`
 * *over* `V`. Ported faithfully from `lean/RelMath/Value/SettlingOverValueCategory.lean`
 * (and the slice of `ClosureOrdinalRegime.lean` it depends on) into the relating
 * substrate — relating's settling was hardwired to the `Charge`/`Valuation`
 * bilattice; this is the layer that lets a settling run over an arbitrary `V`.
 *
 * The corpus's key claim is a **uniformity**: the four-regime stratification of the
 * closure ordinal `κ` — strict(finite) / Scott / transfinite-bounded / aperiodic —
 * is **`V`-independent**. Which regime a settling lands in is decided by `κ`
 * (equivalently by the decidable `ClosureRegimeData`), and that decision never
 * looks at `V`. `V = {0,1}` (Boolean) and `V = FOUR` (Charge) both recover the
 * standard bilattice settling spine.
 *
 * No free data. relating's `ClosureRegime` values are reused, not re-introduced.
 * The Lean carries each structure's laws as proof fields; the faithful TS analog
 * is (a) **finite-exhaustion law judgments** (`partialOrderOver`, `closureOver`)
 * that witness the laws over a sample — the full carrier for a finite `V`, exactly
 * the `decide` the Lean uses — and (b) **smart constructors** that *refuse* to
 * admit data violating the corpus constraints (`closureRegimeData` rejects a finite
 * base that is not Scott-continuous / countably-cofinal, so an invalid datum is
 * unconstructible, as the Lean's proof fields make it). Formalizes
 * `content/.../settling/content/continuous-valued-settling/continuous-valued-settling.md`.
 *
 * This is a finite/sample-checked Node surface. It does not implement a full
 * continuous quantale runtime or prove laws for arbitrary host functions.
