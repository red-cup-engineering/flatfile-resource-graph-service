/**
 * settling/analysis/coloring — proper graph coloring and the chromatic number.
 *
 * A PROPER coloring assigns colors to the vertices of a bare weighted graph (adjacency = a positive
 * weight) so that adjacent vertices DIFFER; the CHROMATIC NUMBER `χ(G)` is the least number of colors
 * admitting one. Computed exactly by backtracking (NP-hard in general, exact and fine for the finite
 * graphs the corpus carries). A proper coloring is, dynamically, a factor map from the graph to a
 * finite palette — for a tiling adjacency graph, a factor of the tiling system onto a finite shift
 * (the "what information does a coloring encode" reading). Grounding: Evans-Gawlak-Ramsey-Strungaru-
 * Trang, "Colourings of aperiodic tilings" (exact vertex/edge/face chromatic numbers for chair,
 * Ammann-Beenker, pinwheel); the Four Color Theorem / Vizing bound the planar-tiling case.
 *
 * NB the adjacency must be a GENUINE relation (geometric tile-adjacency, predication edges), not one
 * derived from a two-valued vertex attribute — such a graph is 2-colored by the attribute itself and
 * its chromatic number is degenerate.
